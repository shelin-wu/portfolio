# How to Add Your Portfolio Images

## Steps to Upload Your Project Images:

1. **Add your images to this folder** (`images/portfolio/`)

2. **Name your images** according to these filenames:
   - `brand-identity.jpg` - For Brand Identity Design project
   - `digital-campaign.jpg` - For Digital Campaign project
   - `print-design.jpg` - For Print Design project
   - `illustration.jpg` - For Illustration Series project
   - `logo-design-1.jpg` - For first Logo Design project
   - `logo-design-2.jpg` - For second Logo Design project
   - `web-design.jpg` - For Web Design project

3. **Image Requirements:**
   - Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP
   - Recommended size: 1200x900px (4:3 aspect ratio)
   - File size: Keep under 500KB for faster loading

4. **After adding images:**
   - The website will automatically display your images
   - If an image is missing, it will show a placeholder
   - Refresh your browser to see the changes

5. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add images/
   git commit -m "Add portfolio images"
   git push origin main
   ```

## Tips:
- Use image optimization tools to reduce file size
- Maintain consistent image dimensions for a clean look
- You can rename the files in `index.html` if you prefer different names
